# RPFX
**RPFX** is a Discord **R**ich **P**resence client **f**or **X**code.

You can show all your friends what you're coding up right now!

RPFX will display the current file you're working on, as well as your workspace.

In addition, it will also show file icons for the following file types:
- `.swift`
- `.playground`
- `.storyboard`
- `.xcodeproj`
- `.h`
- `.m`
- `.cpp`
- `.c`

RPFX is designed to be fairly modular, so you can tweak its code to use your own Discord application if you want to add more file icons (or any other functionality).

## Dependencies
RPFX uses [my fork](https://github.com/PKBeam/SwordRPC) of [Azoy's SwordRPC](https://github.com/Azoy/SwordRPC).

## System Requirements
- macOS Catalina (10.15) 
  - if you're building this yourself, you can try changing the deployment target for an earlier macOS version and it might work
- Xcode installed (otherwise this wouldn't be very useful)

## Usage
When you first start up RPFX, it will prompt you for permission to control Xcode. We don't actually need to *control* Xcode, 
but we need that permission to execute AppleScript to get information on Xcode.

You can verify that RPFX has permissions by opening System Preferences and looking in Security & Privacy under Privacy, then Automation.

That's it, you're done - RPFX will now automatically monitor Xcode.

If you like, you can set RPFX to automatically open on login.
